# 🎯 Lattice Point Counting and the Gauss Circle Problem

This project explores computational approaches to the **Gauss circle problem** and its extension to **arithmetic progressions**, focusing on 2D integer lattices.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Implements lattice point counting methods specific to the standard 2D integer lattice (basis vectors \( e_1 = (1,0) \) and \( e_2 = (0,1) \)).
- Visualizes lattice points and associated geometric structures using Python plotting libraries.
- Includes computational experiments relevant to the Gauss circle problem, central to my MSci research project.
- Contains preliminary work toward lattice counting in higher dimensions and for more general lattices, which remains incomplete.

## 📌 Notes on Scope and Acknowledgements

- The lattice code focuses on the 2D standard lattice, as this was the scope of the Gauss circle problem and arithmetic progressions studied in the MSci project.
- Higher dimensional lattice counting and arbitrary basis lattices are not fully implemented at this stage.
- Some code snippets and ideas were adapted from online resources like Stack Overflow to aid implementation efficiency.
